Hi there ‚úåÔ∏è nice to meet you! I'm an MSCS student at [Northeastern University](https://seattle.northeastern.edu) and aspiring **Software Developer** with a passion for building intelligent systems and crafting seamless user experiences.

With a background in **Mechatronics Engineering** and my ongoing MSCS, I bring a unique blend of full-stack development and engineering expertise. I enjoy working on both **backend systems** and **frontend interfaces**, developing **web applications**, **APIs**, and **IoT**. My expertise in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** allows me to design clean, maintainable systems that deliver both functionality and reliability.

I primarily work with **Python**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, **C++**, and **React**, and have hands-on experience with technologies like **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **AWS**. Whether it's architecting complex backend systems, optimizing performance, or creating intuitive UIs, I love tackling challenges and learning new technologies.

Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new places, trying new cuisines, and capturing moments through photography‚Äîbecause who doesn‚Äôt love a good meal and a great view? üçΩÔ∏èüì∏
